# i3 Configuration File

This is my current i3 configuration file. The parts I've changed are mostly the ones at the end, and contain:

* Some applications that make sense to have as floating windows
* Screen locking
* Keyboard shortcuts to suspend/shutdown/restart
* Wallpaper randomisation
* A few bits of the Dracula theme (mostly the bar)

There are not a lot of visual changes in my configuration; it's just things to make day to day usage easier and to assign actions to keyboard shortcuts that I have in muscle memory anyway.

I am in the process of building an Ubuntu installer that adds i3 with these customisation on top of Ubuntu Server. I'll add more notes on this if it becomes a thing that I think other people could benefit from.

# i3 Configuration File

This is my current i3 config file. The parts I've changed are mostly the ones at the end, and contain:

* Some applications that make sense to have as floating windows
* Screen locking
* Keyboard shortcuts to suspend/shutdown/restart
* Wallpaper randomisation

There isn't a log of visual changes in my configuration; it's just things to make day to day usage easier and to assign actios to keyboard shortcuts that I have in muscle memory anyway.
